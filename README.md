# Wikipedia-Source-Chrome-Extension
An extention for chrome that adds an icon to google search results based on the source reliablility according to Wikipedia

Known Issues:
- Currently, icons are in the incorrect location on the 'News' tab for google search results.
- Webresults with a sub-domain (ie. en.wikipedia.org) will not trigger an icon. Need to add wildcard logic for catching for sub-domains.

Future Enhancements: 
- Addition of other reliable site sources other than just WP:RS/PS.
- Pop-up for icons that show a full explanation of rational, especially for those websites where reliability is dependent on the topic. (ie. FoxNews)
